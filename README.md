Scope: Discover who the five or even ten most famous people are with your first name, based on the most searched names on Google.

Operation: Featuring a system for creating and authenticating accounts, and optional signature, the user can enter their name in the search field, which will initially return five results, containing the five most searched people on Google with that first name. By watching an ad, the user is entitled to see eight results, and with a subscription, ten. The results are returned based on the Google API, which queries which full names are most searched with the first name.
